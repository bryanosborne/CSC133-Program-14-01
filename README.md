NameSearch.com has contracted WizardOfOz Solutions, LLC, to assist in a quest to determine the common first names.

Our task is to write a Python program that reads names from a file, uses a dictionary to count the occurrences of each individual first name, and then lists the five most common first names. 

Use the provided file, nameList.txt, as input.

Make sure the program is very modularized, using functions that could be reused in the future to perform tasks similar tasks.
